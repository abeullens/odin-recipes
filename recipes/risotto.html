      <p>Risotto is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. Risotto in Italy is often a first course served before the main course. There are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients, but they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety, cooked in a standard procedure. In this recipe, we will be making a beetroot risotto. Risotto, unlike other rice dishes, requires constant care and attention.The rice is not to be pre-rinsed, boiled, or drained, as washing would remove much of the starch required for a creamy texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cups arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 litre vegetable stock, hot</li>
        <li>4 ready-cooked beetroot</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup parmesan, finely grated</li>
        <li>1/2 cup feta, crumbled</li>
        <li>1/4 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh thyme leaves</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the beetroot puree.</strong> Blitz your beetroot in a blender or food processor until a smooth puree forms. If it’s getting stuck, add a little water to help it get moving. You should end up with about 3/4 cup. Set it aside for later, then start the risotto.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the onion and garlic.</strong> Melt the butter in a large, high-sided pot or pan, and add the diced onion and 2 teaspoons of salt. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, until the onion is softening nicely and starting to change colour (it’ll look more transparent). At this point, add the garlic and fish sauce, then stir for another minute. Pour in 1/2 cup of wine and let it bubble up for a minute so the alcohol cooks off. Add the rice and stir until every grain is well coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir the risotto.</strong> Add the hot vegetable stock, a ladleful at a time and stir as the stock absorbs into the rice. Once it’s absorbed, add another ladleful. Continue in this way until the rice is JUST about al dente (cooked but still with a bite to it). At that point, you should have roughly 1 ladleful of stock left. Turn the heat off, then add the beetroot puree, lemon zest and juice, then stir it through the risotto (and marvel at the glorious colour!). Turn the heat back on to low, then add the last ladleful of stock and the parmesan. Let the parmesan let it sit on top of the risotto for a minute to start melting, then stir it through.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and serve.</strong> Divide the risotto between plates, then top with a good crumbling of feta, toasted walnuts, the remaining lemon zest and thyme leaves.</li>
      </ol>
